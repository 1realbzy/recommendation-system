## Progress Log

### Week 1 (Current)
- Project initialization and environment setup
- Business understanding and objectives definition
- Data exploration and initial analysis setup
- Created analysis notebooks following CRISP-DM framework
- Weekly progress documentation on Medium

## Business Questions

1. What are the most common user interaction patterns?
2. How do view events correlate with add-to-cart and purchase events?
3. What is the typical conversion funnel from view to purchase?
4. How do item properties influence user behavior?
5. What defines an "abnormal" user in our context?
6. How do seasonal patterns affect user behavior?
7. What are the key features that drive user engagement?

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - Unix/MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook`

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
