# Building a Recommendation System: Week 1 Progress - Business Understanding and Initial Setup

*A deep dive into e-commerce user interactions using the CRISP-DM framework*

## Introduction

In today's data-driven e-commerce landscape, understanding user behavior is crucial for creating effective recommendation systems. This article documents our first week's progress in developing a recommendation system, following the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology.

## Week 1 Accomplishments

### 1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- Initialized the project repository with proper structure
- Set up Python virtual environment with necessary dependencies
- Configured Jupyter Notebook environment for analysis
- Established version control with Git

### 2. Business Understanding Phase
We've defined clear business objectives and formulated key questions to guide our analysis:
- Understanding user interaction patterns
- Analyzing view-to-purchase conversion funnels
- Identifying factors influencing user behavior
- Detecting abnormal user patterns
- Understanding seasonal effects
- Determining key engagement drivers

### 3. Data Understanding
Our dataset exploration revealed:
- Rich user interaction data spanning 4.5 months
- Multiple event types: views, cart additions, and purchases
- Detailed item properties and category relationships
- Temporal information for trend analysis

### 4. Initial Technical Framework
We've established our technical foundation using:
- Python 3.11 as our primary programming language
- Essential data science libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis
- Git for version control and collaboration

## Next Week's Goals

For Week 2, we plan to:
1. Conduct comprehensive exploratory data analysis
2. Develop initial user behavior profiles
3. Analyze conversion funnels in detail
4. Begin feature engineering for our recommendation model
5. Investigate seasonal patterns in user behavior

## Project Structure
We've organized our work into a clear structure:
```
.
├── data/                  # Dataset directory
├── notebooks/            # Analysis notebooks
├── visualizations/       # Generated visualizations
├── docs/                # Documentation
└── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
```

Stay tuned for next week's update as we dive deeper into the data analysis phase of our recommendation system project!
